# patrix
A Bootstrap website created for an imaginary company called patrix.

I uploaded all of the website's images and logos as well as the scss files (for styling) that are the primary focus of the website.



I wrote all of the code in the files uploaded during a [Bootstrap course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJKCj8uAHz8&t=6653s), in which I learned how to use Bootstrap to style my websites.
